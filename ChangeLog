Branch 'master' is quite stable, but quite boring:)
Branch 'experimental' with new features is more interesting;)

Unstable 2
* Dynamic module architecture -- the functionality of the farm can be easily
extended.
* Almost no global variables in use.
* Libreadconfig updated. 
* Full commandline arg handling (popt library).
* New data storage scheme. Master node writes config files, map of pixels and
special vector to master data file. Any other data can be stored, too -- just
code it in your module.

Unstable 1
* Initial release.
* HDF5 storage.
* MPI2 task farm.
* Using libreadconfig for config files.
