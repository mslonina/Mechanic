Requirements
------------

Mechanic should run on Unix-like platforms (Linux and MacOSX are actively
maintained), if following requirements are met:

- gcc >= 4.6 or ifort >= 11.0
- CMake >= 2.8
- MPI2 implementation (optional: Fortran support) (we favour OpenMPI)
- HDF5 >= 1.8
- Popt library
- Libreadconfig with HDF5 support (see http://git.astri.umk.pl/projects/lrc)

Compilation
-----------

    tar -xvvf mechanic-VERSION.tar.gz
    cd mechanic-VERSION
    mkdir build
    cd build
    CC=mpicc FC=mpif90 cmake ..
    make
    make install

If you want to disable Fortran support run

    CC=mpicc cmake .. -DBUILD_FORTRAN:BOOL=OFF


By default, Cmake installs to /usr/local. You can change this by setting
    
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/your/custom/path

Additional modules
------------------

All but core module have been moved to separate project.
