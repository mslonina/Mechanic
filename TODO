This todo list contains some ideas or features...

- Custom storage layout -- this requires adding new template functions available
  for modules. In case the module uses its own storage layout is should provide
  also custom MPI functions accordingly.

- 3D and more -- currently we have 2D mapping of pixels. What if we want to map
  pixels in 3D or more? This depends on secondary separator support in LRC,
  rewrite mapping system, storing status in board etc.
