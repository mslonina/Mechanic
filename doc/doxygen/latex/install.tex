{\tt Mechanic} uses {\tt Waf} build system, see {\tt http://code.google.com/p/waf} for detailes. {\tt Waf} is build in Python, you should have at least Python 2.3 installed on your system.

To download the latest snapshot of {\tt Mechanic} try 

\begin{Code}\begin{verbatim} http://git.astri.umk.pl/?p=Mechanic.git
\end{verbatim}
\end{Code}



We try to keep as less requirements as possible to use {\tt Mechanic}. To compile our software you need at least:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt MPI2} implementation (we prefer {\tt OpenMPI}, and {\tt Mechanic} was tested with it)\item {\tt HDF5}, at least 1.8\item {\tt LibReadConfig} with {\tt HDF5} support -- {\tt LRC} can be downloaded from our git repository, since it is a helper tool builded especially for {\tt Mechanic}, but can be used independly. You need to compile it with {\tt --enable-hdf} flag\item {\tt Popt} library (should be already installed on your system)\item C compiler ({\tt gcc} 4.3 should do the job)\end{itemize}


Compilation is similar to standard {\tt Autotools} path:



\begin{Code}\begin{verbatim} ./waf configure
 ./waf build
 ./waf install
\end{verbatim}
\end{Code}



The default installation path is set to {\tt /usr/local}, but you can change it with {\tt --prefix} flag.

By default, {\tt Mechanic} comes only with core. However, you can consider building additional modules, engines and libraries, as follows: 

\begin{Code}\begin{verbatim} --with-modules=list,of,modules
 --with-engines=list,of,engines
 --with-libs=list,of,libs
\end{verbatim}
\end{Code}



Available modules:\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt hello}, see \doxyref{The Hello Module}{p.}{quickstart_hello}\item {\tt echo}, see \doxyref{The Echo Module}{p.}{advanced_echo}\item {\tt mandelbrot}, see \doxyref{The Mandelbrot Module}{p.}{advanced_mandelbrot}\end{itemize}


Available engines (currently only templates):\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt odex} \item {\tt taylor} \item {\tt gpu} \end{itemize}


Available libs:\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt orbit} -- a library for handling common tasks of celestial mechanics, i.e orbital elements conversion, see \doxyref{The Orbit Library}{p.}{advanced_orbit}\end{itemize}


The documentation can will be builded, with {\tt --with-doc} option.

Altought {\tt Mechanic} requires {\tt MPI}, it can be runned in a single-cpu environments (we call it \char`\"{}fake-MPI\char`\"{}). {\tt Mechanic} should do its job both on 32 and 64-bits architectures with $\ast$nix-like system on board.
